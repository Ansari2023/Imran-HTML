    <h1>Welcome to Maton Karhai</h1>
    <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province of Pakistan, is where the speciality Mutton Karahi was first created 
        in the early 19th century. When discussing its past, 
        we often refer to the lavish banquet hosted by the KPK's minister in Khyber during the 1920s.</p>
