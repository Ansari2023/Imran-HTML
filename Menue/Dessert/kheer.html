        <h1>Welcome to Kheer</h1>
        <p>kheer, a chilled South Asian dessert made from slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar, much like a rice 
            pudding. It is typically flavoured with saffron, cardamom, raisins, and/or various nuts, notably pistachios, cashews, 
            and almonds.</p>
